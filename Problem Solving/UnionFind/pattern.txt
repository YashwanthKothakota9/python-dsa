Union Find, also known as Disjoint Set Union (DSU), is a data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets (meaning no set overlaps with another). It provides two primary operations: find, which determines which subset a particular element is in, and union, which merges two subsets into a single subset. This pattern is particularly useful for problems where we need to find whether 2 elements belong to the same group or need to solve connectivity-related problems in a graph or tree.

Core Operations of Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU):
Find: Determine which set a particular element belongs to. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same set.
Union: Merge two sets together. This operation is used when there is a relationship between two elements, indicating they should be in the same set.

Union-Find: A Story of Connections
Imagine a social network where everyone is initially a single user with no friends. The moment two users become friends, they form a group. If a user befriends someone from another group, the two groups merge into a larger friend circle. Union-Find helps track these friendships and circles.

How DSU Work?
Initial State: Everyone is in their own separate group. Think of each person as their own little island.
Making Connections (Union): When two people shake hands, they now belong to the same group. If they were already in groups, their entire groups merge.
Checking Connections (Find): Want to know if two people are connected? Union-Find can check if they're in the same group.

How DSU is Implemented?
Parents Array: Each element has a parent. In the beginning, each element is their own parent.
Find Operation: Follows the chain of parents until it reaches the root parent, which represents the group.
Union Operation: Connects two groups by setting the parent of one group’s root to the other group’s root.


Naive Implementation of Disjoint Set
1. Creating Disjoint Sets
Each element points to a parent.
Initially, each element is its own parent, forming n disjoint sets.
A "root" element is one that points to itself, identifying the set's representative.

2. Find Operation
The Find operation determines which set a particular element belongs to. This can be used to determine if two elements are in the same set.

In the below code:

parent is an array where parent[i] is the parent of i.
If parent[i] == i, then i is the root of the set and hence the representative.
The find function follows the chain of parents for i until it reaches the root.

Above function recursively traverses the parent array until it finds a node that is the parent of itself.

Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: In the naive implementation, the time complexity of the find operation is O(N), where (N) is the number of elements. This is because, in the worst case, when all elements are in the same set, we may have to traverse up to (N) elements to find the representative.
Space Complexity: The space complexity of the find operation is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of extra space.

3. Union Operation
The Union operation merges two disjoint sets. It takes two elements as input, finds the representatives of their sets using the Find operation, and finally merges the two sets.

In the code below:

Find the Representatives:

int irep = find(i); – Finds the representative (root) of the set containing element i.
int jrep = find(j); – Finds the representative (root) of the set containing element j.
Check if They Are in the Same Set:

if (irep == jrep) { return; } – If i and j have the same representative, they are already in the same set, so no union is needed.
Merge the Sets:

parent[irep] = jrep; – Makes the representative of i's set point to the representative of j's set, effectively merging the two sets.

Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: The time complexity of the union operation is dominated by the time complexity of the find operation, making it O(N) in the worst case.
Space Complexity: The space complexity of the union operation is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space.


Optimizations
Here are various methods for optimally performing operations on disjoint sets.

1. Path Compression
Path compression is a technique used in the Union-Find data structure to flatten the structure of the tree whenever the find operation is called. This optimization significantly reduces the time complexity of the find operation, making subsequent operations faster.

The idea is to make each node on the path from a node to the root point directly to the root. This way, whenever we perform a find operation, we not only find the root but also make the structure flatter, which helps in reducing the depth of the trees.

Here’s how path compression works:

When we call find on a node, we recursively traverse its parent until we reach the root.
During this traversal, we make each node on the path point directly to the root.

'''
def find(i):
    # If i is the parent of itself
    if Parent[i] == i:
        # Then i is the representative of its set
        return i
    else:
        # Recursively find the representative of the set that i belongs to
        result = find(Parent[i])
        
        # Path Compression: Directly connect i to the representative of its set
        Parent[i] = result
        
        # Return the representative
        return result
'''


This modified Find operation ensures that every node directly points to the representative of the set, and it makes it easy to find the representative of any two elements.


Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: With path compression, the time complexity of the find operation is reduced to O(logN). This is because path compression flattens the structure of the tree, reducing the depth of the tree significantly. In each find operation, we make each node on the path point directly to the root, which decreases the depth of the tree and ensures that subsequent find operations are faster. This effectively reduces the maximum height of the tree to O(logN).

Space Complexity: The space complexity remains (O(1)) as find() operation doesn't use the extra space.


2. Union by Rank
Union by rank is an optimization technique used in the Union-Find data structure to keep the tree flat and balanced. In the naive approach, the trees can become skewed, resulting in a high time complexity for the find and union operations. Union by rank addresses this issue by always attaching the smaller tree under the root of the larger tree, thereby minimizing the height of the resulting tree.

Why Union by Rank is Important:

Prevents Skewed Trees: In the naive approach, repeated union operations can result in highly unbalanced trees. This can degrade the time complexity of the find operation to O(N).
Maintains Balanced Trees: By attaching the smaller tree under the larger tree, union by rank ensures that the resulting tree remains balanced, keeping the operations efficient.


How Rank is Maintained:

Rank Array: We maintain a Rank array where Rank[i] denotes the rank (or height) of the tree rooted at element i.
Union Operation: When performing the union of two sets, we compare the ranks of their roots:
If the ranks are different, the root with the higher rank becomes the parent.
If the ranks are the same, we arbitrarily choose one root to be the parent and increment its rank by 1.


```
Rank[n]

# Union function to merge two sets
Union(u, v):
    # Find the representative (root) of the set containing u
    u = Find(u)
    # Find the representative (root) of the set containing v
    v = Find(v)
    
    # If u and v are not in the same set
    If(u != v):
        # Compare the ranks of the sets
        If(Rank[u] < Rank[v]):
            # Swap u and v to ensure the larger rank is used as the new root
            Swap(u, v)
        
        # Make u the parent of v (i.e., merge the sets)
        parent[v] = u
        
        # If the ranks of the two sets were the same, increment the rank of the new root
        If(Rank[u] == Rank[v]):
            Rank[u]++
```

This function uses the rank array to decide which tree gets attached under which tree.

Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: The time complexity of the union operation with union by rank is O(logN). This is because union by rank keeps the trees balanced, ensuring that the maximum height of the tree remains logarithmic with respect to the number of elements.
Space Complexity: O(N), as we use the rank array.


3. Union by Size
Union by size is another optimization technique used in the Union-Find data structure to keep the tree flat and balanced. Similar to union by rank, union by size helps to avoid the creation of skewed trees by always attaching the smaller tree under the larger tree. This keeps the height of the trees small, ensuring that the find and union operations remain efficient.

How Size is Maintained:

Size Array: We maintain a size array where size[i] denotes the size (number of elements) of the tree rooted at element i.
Union Operation: When performing the union of two sets, we compare the sizes of their roots:
If the sizes are different, the root of the smaller set becomes a child of the root of the larger set.
The size of the new root is updated to reflect the total number of elements in the merged set.

```
def unionbysize(i, j):
    # Find the representatives of the two sets.
    irep = find(i)
    jrep = find(j)
    
    # If they are already in the same set, return.
    if irep == jrep:
        return
    
    # Attach the smaller tree under the larger tree.
    if size[irep] < size[jrep]:
        parent[irep] = jrep
        size[jrep] += size[irep]
    else:
        parent[jrep] = irep
        size[irep] += size[jrep]
```

This function uses the size array to ensure that the tree with fewer nodes is added under the tree with more nodes.

Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: The time complexity of the union operation with union by size is O(logN). This is because union by size ensures that the trees remain balanced by attaching the smaller tree to the larger one, keeping the tree height logarithmic with respect to the number of elements.
Space Complexity: O(N), as we use the rank array.


Most Optimized Approach: Combining Path Compression and Union by Rank
In the previous sections, we discussed two important optimizations for the Union-Find data structure: Path Compression and Union by Rank. Each of these optimizations addresses specific issues related to tree depth and efficiency. By combining these two optimizations, we can achieve the most efficient Union-Find implementation.

Combining Path Compression and Union by Rank
Path Compression: This technique flattens the tree structure whenever the find operation is called. It does so by making each node on the path from a node to the root point directly to the root. This significantly reduces the depth of the tree, ensuring that subsequent find operations are faster.

Union by Rank: This technique ensures that the tree remains balanced during union operations. By always attaching the smaller tree under the root of the larger tree (based on rank), we prevent the tree from becoming too deep. This optimization helps maintain a logarithmic tree height, keeping the operations efficient.

Combining these two optimizations, we get a highly efficient Union-Find structure where both the find and union operations are optimized.

Example Code
To implement this combined approach, we maintain two arrays: parent and rank. The parent array keeps track of the parent or representative of each node, while the rank array helps manage the depth of the trees.

```
# Python3 program to implement Disjoint Set Data Structure.

class Solution:
    def __init__(self, n):
        # Constructor: Initialize sets of n items.
        # rank: Store the depth of trees (used for union by rank).
        self.rank = [1] * n
        # parent: Store the parent of each item. Initially, every item is its own parent.
        self.parent = [i for i in range(n)]

    def find(self, x):
        # If x is not its own parent, then it's not the representative of its set.
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            # Path Compression: Connect x directly to its set's representative.
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        # Return the representative of the set.
        return self.parent[x]

    def Union(self, x, y):
        # Find the representatives (or the root nodes) for x and y.
        xset = self.find(x)
        yset = self.find(y)

        # If x and y are already in the same set, return.
        if xset == yset:
            return

        # Union by Rank:
        # Attach the tree with a smaller rank under the root of the tree with a larger rank.
        if self.rank[xset] < self.rank[yset]:
            self.parent[xset] = yset
        elif self.rank[xset] > self.rank[yset]:
            self.parent[yset] = xset
        # If ranks are the same, choose one tree and increment its rank.
        else:
            self.parent[yset] = xset
            self.rank[xset] += 1

# Driver code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a disjoint set data structure with 5 elements.
    obj = Solution(5)
    # Merge sets that contain 0 and 2.
    obj.Union(0, 2)
    # Merge sets that contain 4 and 2.
    obj.Union(4, 2)
    # Merge sets that contain 3 and 1.
    obj.Union(3, 1)
    # Check if 4 and 0 are in the same set.
    if obj.find(4) == obj.find(0):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
    # Check if 1 and 0 are in the same set.
    if obj.find(1) == obj.find(0):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

Complexity Analysis of the Most Optimized Approach
By combining Path Compression and Union by Rank, we achieve a highly efficient Union-Find data structure. The amortized time complexity for both find and union operations is O(alpha(n)), where alpha(n) is the inverse Ackermann function.


Inverse Ackermann Function
The Ackermann function grows extremely fast, and its inverse, alpha(n), grows very slowly. For practical purposes, alpha(n) remains nearly constant. Even for very large inputs (e.g., n<=10^600) alpha(n)  does not exceed 5. This means:

{alpha(n) = min(k:Ak(1)>=n)}

Some values of the Ackermann function:

A0(1)=1
A1(1)=3
A2(1)=7
A3(1)=2047
A4(1)>>10^80

Given this slow growth, the time complexity of the combined approach is effectively constant.

Time Complexity: The amortized time complexity for find and union operations is O(alpha(n)), which is nearly constant.
Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n) due to the parent and rank arrays.
Combining these optimizations ensures that the Union-Find data structure operates efficiently, making it suitable for handling large datasets with minimal overhead.


Pros and Cons of DSU
Pros:
Efficiency: Provides near constant time operations for union and find operations, making it highly efficient.
Simplicity: Once set up, it’s straightforward to use for solving problems related to disjoint sets.
Cons:
Space Overhead: Requires additional space to store the parent and rank of each element.
Initial Setup: Requires initial setup to create and initialize the data structure.

Why Choose Union-Find Over BFS/DFS?
You can solve similar problems using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms, but the Union Find algorithm provides the optimal solution over them. For problems related to connectivity checks and component identification, Union-Find is often more efficient than BFS/DFS.

Time Complexity:
BFS/DFS: For BFS and DFS, the time complexity is O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This can be quite slow for large graphs.
Union-Find: With path compression and union by rank, the amortized time complexity for union and find operations can be approximated as O(alpha(n)), where alpha(n) is the inverse Ackermann function. This function grows very slowly, making Union-Find operations almost constant time in practice.
Let's jump onto our first problem and apply the Union Find pattern.
