# Given two lists of intervals, find the intersection of these two lists. Each list consists of disjoint intervals sorted on their start time.

# Example 1:

# Input: arr1=[[1, 3], [5, 6], [7, 9]], arr2=[[2, 3], [5, 7]]
# Output: [2, 3], [5, 6], [7, 7]
# Explanation: The output list contains the common intervals between the two lists.
# Example 2:

# Input: arr1=[[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 12]], arr2=[[5, 10]]
# Output: [5, 7], [9, 10]
# Explanation: The output list contains the common intervals between the two lists.

# Now, if we have found that the two intervals overlap, how can we find the overlapped part?

# Again from the above diagram, the overlapping interval will be equal to:

#     start = max(a.start, b.start)
#     end = min(a.end, b.end) 
# That is, the highest start time and the lowest end time will be the overlapping interval.

# So our algorithm will be to iterate through both the lists together to see if any two intervals overlap. If two intervals overlap, we will insert the overlapped part into a result list and move on to the next interval which is finishing early.
